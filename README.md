## Commands

TSDX scaffolds your new library inside `/src`.

To run TSDX, use:

```bash
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Testing

Jest tests are set up to run with `yarn test`.
